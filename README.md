# Python Every Street Generator

Python code to create paths to be used for #everystreet challenge. The code is inspired by [everystreet](https://github.com/matejker/everystreet).

## Disclaimer

Original code from `everystreet` has dependencies of author's own network library, `osmnx`. Since we only use a small portion of this library, I'd like to make this package as light as possible, so that have lesser dependencies.
    - Also, `osmnx` comes with `fiona` which requires external `GDAL` library (outside `pip` world).
